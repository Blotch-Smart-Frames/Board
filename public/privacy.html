      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="updated">Last updated: February 16, 2025</p>

      <p>
        Board by Blotch ("we", "our", or "the app") is a task management
        application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and
        protect your information when you use our service.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        When you sign in with Google, we receive and store the following
        information from your Google account:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Name</strong> — your display name, used to identify you within
          shared boards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Email address</strong> — used for account identification and
          board collaboration invitations.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Profile photo URL</strong> — displayed as your avatar within
          the app.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We also store data you create within the app, including boards, lists,
        and cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you enable Google Calendar sync, we access your Google Calendar data
        using the
        <code>calendar</code> and <code>calendar.events</code> OAuth scopes.
        This allows us to read, create, update, and delete calendar events
        linked to your tasks. We only access calendar events that are created or
        managed by Board by Blotch.
      </p>

      <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>
        Your information is used solely to provide and improve the Board by
        Blotch service:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Authenticate your identity and maintain your session.</li>
        <li>Display your profile to collaborators on shared boards.</li>
        <li>
          Enable collaboration features such as board sharing and assignee
          selection.
        </li>
        <li>Store and retrieve your boards, lists, and cards.</li>
        <li>
          Sync tasks with your Google Calendar when you enable calendar sync —
          creating, updating, and removing calendar events to reflect your task
          due dates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read changes from your Google Calendar to keep linked tasks up to date
          (e.g. if you reschedule an event in Google Calendar, the task's due
          date is updated accordingly).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>
        Your data is stored in Google Firebase (Firestore), which provides
        encryption at rest and in transit. We do not store your Google password.
        Authentication is handled entirely by Google's OAuth 2.0 service.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
      <p>
        We do not sell, trade, or rent your personal information to third
        parties. Your data may be visible to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Other users you explicitly invite to collaborate on a board.</li>
        <li>
          Firebase/Google Cloud infrastructure as our hosting and database
          provider.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>Board by Blotch uses the following third-party services:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Firebase</strong> — authentication, database, and
          hosting.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Google OAuth 2.0</strong> — sign-in authentication.</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Google Calendar API</strong> — two-way sync between tasks and
          calendar events.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to
        review

          feature.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not allow humans to read your Google Calendar data unless it is

          consent, or we are required to do so by law.
        </li>
        <li>
          We do not transfer Google Calendar data to third parties except as
          necessary to provide the service (via Firebase/Google Cloud
          infrastructure) or as required by law.
        </li>
      </ul>
