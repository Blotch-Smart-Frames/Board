# Board by Blotch

A simple, visual way to organize your work. Create boards, add tasks, and drag them across columns to track progress — just like sticky notes on a whiteboard, but better.

## What You Can Do

- **Organize with boards and lists** — Set up columns like "To Do", "In Progress", and "Done", then drag tasks between them as work moves forward.
- **Collaborate with your team** — Share a board with others and see who's online in real time.
- **Label and categorize** — Tag tasks with color-coded labels and emoji so you can spot what matters at a glance.
- **Sync with Google Calendar** — Attach due dates to tasks and have them appear on your calendar automatically.
- **Sign in with Google** — No new account needed. Just sign in with your existing Google account.

## Getting Started

1. Open the app and sign in with your Google account.
2. Create a new board from the sidebar.
3. Add lists (columns) to represent stages of your workflow.
4. Add tasks, drag them around, label them, and share the board with your team.
